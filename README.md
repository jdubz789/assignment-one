# assignment-one (build a splash page)

I focussed on the html side of the document using mainly div & p tags and ensuring I used a footer to make better use for the copyright information.
I then went over to css to work through some css selectors adding a border radius of 15px to round the border and using the justify content/text align to centralise text and containers. I then made further adjustments by adding the class ‘container contact info’ as I felt the gap needed to be reduced so it was closer to the template. 

There were still some adjustments to be made to the text, I found a font on google image that I thought was quite close to the template and copy pasted the url in the head, I then wanted to target the second and third p tags in the business info div so I created nth child 2 to enlarge the business name so it stands out and nth child 3 to change the colour to grey. I then changed all box colours and borders to white and found the copyright box was overlapping the border so I changed the width to 90px to shrink the size

I then looked over some of the stretch goals requested in the assignment and decided to create a ‘chat to us’ button using absolute positioning and using the company colours as suggested writing in blue, red background & highlighted green with a pointer cursor when hovering.
Finally I added a welcome message as I was unsure on how to go about doing this using Java 



(Reflection)

I tried to get it done to the best of my ability, I think having some time away from the keyboard when I became frustrated really helped as mind went blank at times. I am slowly getting there, but I feel like I am struggling to get some of the basics hopefully as I progress through the course I’ll be quicker. I found google searches and chat gpt helped when creating some css selectors (example) the nth child which I have a little understanding on now after playing the css diner.

Any feedback on what I could have done better would be appreciated.
